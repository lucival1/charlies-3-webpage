In your first assignment, you were tasked with developing a website for a business. The
technologies which were used focused around basic HTML/CSS. During this process
you would have seen that attempting to make a website look good can be a difficult
task.
To make our websites more interactive, JavaScript can help us. In the lectures, we
talked about JavaScript and the benefits that libraries such as jQuery UI have during the
development process.
The business owner of the business you built the website for, has asked you to take the
website a step further, and create an online ordering system which will allow customers
to purchase products (be it hotel rooms, or gifts, or whichever industry you are working
for).
The business owner has specified that he would like it to be as flashy as possible, and
utilise all of the JavaScript technologies that are currently available.
